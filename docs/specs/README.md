# unify-kit-example-nextjs — Specifications

This directory holds the durable behavioral contracts for unify-kit-example-nextjs.
Specs describe **behavior**, not implementation. They are the law that
GitHub issues amend; they ship in the same PR as the code that updates them.

For the full discipline — module vs journey, drift fix vs behavior change,
the seven specification-discipline hard rules — see
`<consumer>/docs/methodology.md` §B (Specification-Driven Development).

## Module specs

One file per system slice. Document a single module's behavior, data model,
permissions, edge cases, compliance notes, integration points. Aim 200–500
lines per spec.

| # | Module | Tier | Last reviewed | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [`<module-name>`](modules/<module-name>.md) | 1 \| 2 | YYYY-MM-DD | active \| draft \| deprecated |

## Journey specs

One file per cross-module user flow. Document the user-observable sequence
in Given/When/Then steps; link to the per-module rules in module specs.
Aim 100–300 lines per spec. Each Tier-1 journey has at least one `@daily`
e2e test counterpart.

| # | Journey | Tier | Verifying e2e test | Last reviewed | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [`<journey-slug>`](journeys/<journey-slug>.md) | 1 \| 2 | [`<file>.spec.ts`](tests/e2e<file>.spec.ts) | YYYY-MM-DD | active \| draft \| deprecated |

## Adding a spec

1. Copy [`templates/specs/module.md.template`](../../templates/specs/module.md.template)
   or [`templates/specs/journey.md.template`](../../templates/specs/journey.md.template)
   into `modules/` or `journeys/`. (Adjust the path to wherever the kit's
   templates live in your project.)
2. Follow the duplicate-this-file checklist in the template's HTML comment header.
3. Add a row to the appropriate table above.
4. Land the spec in the same PR as the code change it documents — never a
   separate PR.

## Tier-1 selection rubric

Pick a Tier-1 module or journey when at least two are true:

- **Highest leverage** — most-changed, central to multiple user flows.
- **Security-sensitive or compliance-critical** — auth, audit, data residency,
  consent capture.
- **Freshest in memory** — recently shipped or actively under development.

Tier-2 specs are bootstrapped on first-touch by `/work-issue` Phase 0
(Spec Sync). No big-bang migration; specs accumulate on use.
