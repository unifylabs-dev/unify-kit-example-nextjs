# unify-kit-example-nextjs — MCP Policy

Any Model Context Protocol server installed in this project must be on the
allowlist below. Adding an MCP is a code change with a review gate; removing
one is a code change with a notice. The five-step vetting workflow is the
same for every addition.

## 1. Allowlist

The currently approved MCPs:

| MCP | Purpose | Provenance | Approved-by | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <name> | <one-line purpose> | <upstream URL or `built-in`> | <reviewer> | <YYYY-MM-DD> |

<!-- Example row (delete before shipping; here for shape):
| `supabase` | Database introspection + query | github.com/supabase/mcp-server | Unify Labs | 2026-05-04 |
-->

If the table is empty, no MCPs are approved yet. Open an issue per the "Adding
an MCP" process below before installing anything.

## 2. Vetting workflow

Every addition runs this five-step pattern. None of the steps are optional.

1. **Provenance**. Where did the MCP come from? Anthropic-published / first-party
   vendor (Supabase, Stripe, etc.) / community / unknown. Stop at "unknown" until
   you can answer.
2. **Code review**. Read the source. Look for unexpected outbound network calls,
   shell exec, broad filesystem access, or unscoped permissions. If the MCP
   isn't open source, escalate — the trust model is different.
3. **Permissions**. List the permissions the MCP requests. Justify each one.
   Refuse anything broader than necessary.
4. **Testing**. Install in a sandboxed environment first (a worktree, a fresh
   `~/.claude` profile, or a temporary repo). Exercise the MCP against
   non-sensitive data. Verify it behaves as documented.
5. **Monitoring**. Once installed, the `mcp-config-integrity.sh` hook
   (`hooks/mcp-config-integrity.sh`) flags drift. Treat drift as a security
   event until proven otherwise.

## 3. Adding an MCP

1. Open a GitHub issue titled `mcp: add <name>`. Link the upstream and a
   one-paragraph rationale.
2. Run the five-step vetting workflow above. Document each step's outcome in
   the issue.
3. Request sign-off from a reviewer with security context (see
   `templates/cheatsheet.md.template` Appendix A — `ce-security-reviewer`).
4. Update the allowlist table in this file with the new row.
5. Merge.

## 4. Removing an MCP

When to remove: provenance changes, the maintainer abandons the project, the
permissions surface widens, or the team's actual usage drops to zero. Removal
is a single PR that strikes the row from the allowlist and removes any
configuration that referenced the MCP. Communicate the removal in the team
channel; downstream tooling may still reference it.

## 5. Project-level vs. user-level MCPs

Project-level MCPs (configured in `.mcp.json` at the repo root) apply to every
contributor working in this repo. Their entries belong on this allowlist.
User-level MCPs (configured in the contributor's `~/.claude/settings.json`)
are personal tools — they don't go on this allowlist, but they should still
follow the five-step vetting workflow. Treat user-level installs as analogous
to installing a development extension: scoped to you, not the team.
