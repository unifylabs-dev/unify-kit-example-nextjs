# unify-kit-example-nextjs — AI Usage Charter

This charter captures how this team uses AI assistance. It exists to set
expectations early so AI usage compounds with discipline rather than papering
over its absence. Keep it short; revisit when practice diverges.

## 1. Scope

AI assistance is permitted for: writing code, drafting tests, refactoring,
exploring designs, summarizing diffs, and authoring documentation. AI assistance
is not permitted for: bypassing review gates, handling raw production
credentials, ingesting customer PII without redaction, or producing prose that
will be published unedited as the team's voice.

**Hard rule.** AI-generated code must pass the same review as human code.
Direct merges of un-reviewed AI output are not permitted. Relax via ADR only.

## 2. Required sequences

- Use `/work-issue <N>` for any issue with acceptance criteria. The 8-phase
  flow exists so AI-assisted work picks up the same gates as human-assisted
  work.
- Brainstorm before non-trivial new features (`/brainstorm` → `writing-plans`
  → `executing-plans`). Skipping brainstorming on ambiguous requests trades a
  short conversation now for re-work later.
- Test-Driven Development for new behavior. Red → Green → Refactor. If GREEN
  fails 3 times for the same AC, stop and ask.

## 3. MCP allowlist

See `templates/mcp-policy.md.template`. The filled-in copy lives at the
project's chosen path (typically alongside this charter). Adding an MCP requires
a PR and the 5-step vetting workflow described there.

## 4. Code review expectations

AI-assisted commits should be noted in the PR description. The review gate is
the same as for human-authored code — there is no fast-track. Reviewers may
invoke any of the agents in `templates/cheatsheet.md.template` Appendix A.

## 5. Prompt hygiene

- Never paste secrets (API keys, database URLs, session tokens) into prompts.
- Never paste customer data, PII, or PHI without redaction.
- Never paste proprietary third-party content the project doesn't own a license
  to redistribute.

## 6. Escalation

Stop and ask a human when: the GREEN phase fails 3 times in a row in TDD; the
acceptance criteria are ambiguous; the change touches an unfamiliar
cross-cutting subsystem (auth, billing, schema); or the cost of being wrong
exceeds the cost of asking. Escalation is cheaper than rollback.
