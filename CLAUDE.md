# unify-kit-example-nextjs

> Synthetic Next.js sandbox dogfooding unify-kit v1.0.0.

This file is project memory for Claude Code. Keep it accurate; stale entries
teach errors. Update in the same commit as the code change that invalidates a
section. Stack-specific patterns live in `templates/snippets/` and are appended
here à la carte by consumers on Next.js (or skipped on other stacks).

## 1. Project Overview

- **Name**: unify-kit-example-nextjs
- **Description**: Synthetic Next.js sandbox dogfooding unify-kit v1.0.0.
- **Repository**: https://github.com/unifylabs-dev/unify-kit-example-nextjs
- **Stack**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind

## 2. Architecture

Replace this skeleton with the project-specific architecture summary; cross-link
to `docs/architecture.md` if it exists.

- **Entry points**: <describe the user-visible entry points — web, CLI, jobs>
- **Data layer**: <describe persistence — database engine, schema-management approach, key tables>
- **External services**: <list third-party integrations and their roles>

## 3. Conventions

- **Commit convention**: Conventional Commits encouraged (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`).
- **File naming**: follow the canonical style for TypeScript (lowercase-dash for shell, kebab-case for routes, PascalCase for components — adapt per stack).
- **Component patterns**: keep concerns local; lift state up only when two siblings need it.
- **Imports**: project-specific path-aliases; avoid deep relative paths (`../../../`).
- **Error handling**: never swallow errors silently — log, surface, or propagate.

### Branch Naming

`<type>/<issue-number>-<kebab-description>` where type is one of `feature/`,
`fix/`, `chore/`, `refactor/`. Created via:

```bash
gh issue develop <N> --name <branch> --checkout --base main
```

The `gh issue develop` command is the canonical issue-to-branch hop — it
wires the new branch back to the GitHub issue automatically, so the issue
closes when the resulting PR merges. Example: `feature/83-staff-management`.

## 4. Issue-Driven Development

Use `/work-issue <N>` for any GitHub issue with acceptance criteria. The 8-phase
gated workflow (Phase 0 — Spec Sync — through Phase 7 — PR creation): spec sync
→ analysis → branch → planning → TDD → verification → review prep → PR creation.
Ships in the `superpowers` + `compound-engineering` plugins. Phase 0 reads
`<consumer>/docs/specs/` before any code work; see `docs/methodology.md` §B
(Specification-Driven Development) and §D (Issue-driven dev) for the contract.
See `templates/cheatsheet.md.template` for the daily command list — this file
does not restate it.

### Specification Discipline

`/work-issue` Phase 0 reads `<consumer>/docs/specs/` before any code work
begins. Hard rules (full discipline in `docs/methodology.md` §B):

- Every issue with non-trivial behavior change lists "Spec sections affected"
  in its body. Pure drift fixes write `None — fixing drift from spec`.
- Specs ship in the same PR as the code that implements them. Never separate PRs.
- The spec describes behavior, not implementation. Don't quote schemas or copy
  function signatures into specs — link via `code_anchors:` and describe in prose.
- Module specs 200–500 lines; journey specs 100–300 lines. Longer = documenting
  implementation; start over.
- Bug-fix-only PRs (drift fix, no behavior change) tick the "no spec changes
  needed" box in the PR template.

See `templates/specs/{module,journey,README}.md.template` for the spec
scaffolding.

## 5. TDD Enforcement

Red-Green-Refactor. Don't modify existing passing tests to accommodate new code;
if existing tests break, fix the implementation, not the tests. If GREEN fails
3 times for the same acceptance criterion, stop and ask for help. The
`superpowers:test-driven-development` skill enforces this.

## 6. Test Strategy

- **Pyramid**: unit / integration / e2e.
- **CI command**: `npm test` (the gate for PRs).
- **Full local**: `npm test` (slower; run before merging anything load-bearing).
- **Tier discipline**: keep unit tests fast and isolated; use integration tests for cross-module contracts; reserve e2e for user-visible flows.

## 7. Documentation Requirements

Doc-on-ship rule: every PR that ships user-visible behavior updates the project's
living-doc set in the same commit. Stale docs teach errors. The starter list:

- `README.md` — setup, status, quickstart.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — per-PR `[Unreleased]` entry.
- `docs/architecture.md` — system design, updated when shape changes.

Add project-specific files here (PRD, runbooks, user guides) and tag which
behavior changes require which file to update.

### PR Merge Process

Before merging any PR, complete this checklist:

1. Run the full test suite (`npm test`) — all tests pass (0 failures).
2. Run the production build (`npm run build`) — no errors.
3. Feature verification: trace each test-plan item end-to-end; confirm
   authorization, session, and data-isolation checks are in place; confirm
   test coverage exists for happy path + error paths.
4. Merge: `gh pr merge <number> --merge` (or your team's policy).
5. Pull updated default branch locally; confirm a clean working tree.
6. Update the project's living-doc set per the §"Documentation Requirements"
   list above. Same commit if the PR didn't already cover them.

This checklist is non-negotiable — never merge without running tests and build
first. The PR template's Verification Checklist mirrors items 1–3.

## 8. Living Document Rules

CLAUDE.md is a self-improving reference. Update it when:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| New pattern established | Add to the relevant section. |
| Bug caused by missing knowledge | Add a gotcha to prevent recurrence. |
| New env var or public route added | Update the relevant section (if your project carries Environment Variables or Middleware sections). |
| Feature shipped | Update the Version Status table (if your project carries one). |
| Outdated info found | Remove or correct — stale docs are worse than none. |

Any session that ships a feature or fixes a bug SHOULD update this file in the
same commit if the change introduces a pattern, convention, or gotcha not
already documented. See `docs/methodology.md` §G (kit doc — link from your
README) for the universal Living Documents principle.

Stack-specific patterns are NOT in this template. They live in `templates/snippets/`.
A consumer using Next.js patterns appends snippet content into their filled-in `CLAUDE.md`.
