Sourcing mode: customization (per specs/00-vision-and-license.md §"Sourcing modes")
Stack-agnostic PR template; structurally inspired by a real consumer
project's pull_request_template.md, no expression lifted. Test/build
commands parameterized via npm test and npm run build.

When you adopt this template, save it as `<consumer>/.github/pull_request_template.md`
(strip the `.template` suffix; lowercase filename per GitHub's convention)
and search-and-replace the `{{...}}` tokens.
