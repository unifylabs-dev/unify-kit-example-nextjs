# unify-kit-example-nextjs — Cheatsheet

The pocket reference for working in this project. Skip the long docs on day one;
read this. Everything here is one click into a longer canon (`docs/methodology.md`,
the project's `<consumer>/CLAUDE.md`, or a kit skill).

## Daily slash-commands

| Command | When to invoke | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/work-issue <N>` | Any GitHub issue with acceptance criteria. | Runs the 8-phase gated flow (Phase 0–7): spec sync → analysis → branch → planning → TDD → verification → review prep → PR creation. Phase 0 (Spec Sync) reads `<consumer>/docs/specs/` before any code work — see `docs/methodology.md` §B + §D. |
| `/brainstorm` | Ambiguous requests, new features, "we should probably…". | One question at a time, multiple choice, narrow scope. Hands off to `writing-plans`. |
| `/phase` | Cross-cutting work (>8 files / >2 subsystems / >12 task bullets / natural break points). | Master plan + per-phase specs + handoffs + verification gates. |
| `/lfg` | Well-scoped autonomous work where you've already aligned on approach. | Continuous execution; you can interrupt with course corrections. |
| `/ship` | Final commit + push + PR in one step. | Wraps up an end-of-task flow. After ship, update the project's living-doc set per `<consumer>/CLAUDE.md` §"Documentation Requirements" — see `docs/methodology.md` §G. |
| `/review` | Want a second opinion on the current diff before pushing. | Pairs well with one or more reviewer agents (see Appendix A). |
| `/commit` | Stage and create a single commit. | For when you don't want push or PR yet. |
| `/commit-push-pr` | Same as `/ship` but explicit about each step. | Useful when you want commit-vs-PR separation in your head. |

## Daily skills

| Skill | Use when |
|---|---|
| `brainstorming` | Before any non-trivial new feature or design decision. Don't skip; AI amplifies whatever discipline you have. |
| `writing-plans` / `executing-plans` | After brainstorming. Plan first, execute under hard gates. |
| `test-driven-development` | Any new behavior. Red → Green → Refactor; stop after 3 GREEN failures and ask. |
| `verification-before-completion` | Before claiming "done." Run the suite, run typecheck, re-read the diff, cross-reference each AC. |

## Build / test / lint / typecheck

| Command | What | When |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run build` | Build the project. | Before pushing if your branch touches build-affecting code. |
| `npm test` | Tests that run in CI. | Before opening a PR. |
| `npm test` | Full local test suite (slower / e2e / integration). | Before merging anything load-bearing. |
| `npm run lint` | Lint. | Before pushing. |
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | Type check. | Before pushing if your stack has one. |

## Conventions

| Convention | Rule |
|---|---|
| Branch name | `<type>/<issue-number>-<kebab-description>` (type ∈ `feature/` `fix/` `chore/` `refactor/`) |
| Branch creation | `gh issue develop <N> --name <branch> --checkout --base main` (canonical issue-to-branch hop; auto-closes issue when PR merges) |
| Spec discipline | Specs ship in the same PR as code. See `docs/methodology.md` §B. |
| Living docs | Update on every ship. See `docs/methodology.md` §G + `<consumer>/CLAUDE.md` §"Documentation Requirements". |

## Context thresholds

| % | Action | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 0–50% | Work freely. | Cache warm; no concern. |
| 50–70% | Pay attention; finish current focused work before adding scope. | The next big jump degrades quality. |
| 70–90% | `/compact` to summarize. | Brings context back into a usable window without losing the thread. |
| 90%+ | `/clear` (mandatory). | Past 90%, the agent starts hallucinating from truncated context. |

Rationale: anchored on the prompt-cache 5-minute TTL + observed agent behavior under context pressure (see `docs/methodology.md` §H).

## Plan mode + phasing trigger

- **Plan mode**: enter via `EnterPlanMode` for any non-trivial change. Mandatory before phase execution.
- **Phasing**: invoke `/phase` for cross-cutting work (the >8 / >2 / >12 / natural-break-points heuristics above). Skip for single-file changes, refactors with no new logic, typos, or "just do it."

## Appendix A — Which reviewer when

| Reviewer | Use when | Invoke via |
|---|---|---|
| `compound-engineering:ce-kieran-typescript-reviewer` | TypeScript / TS-strictness review of recently changed code. | `Agent` tool with `subagent_type` set to the reviewer's name. |
| `compound-engineering:ce-security-reviewer` (alias `security-sentinel`) | Auth, permission, credential-handling, or anything PHI/PII-adjacent. | `Agent` tool, or via the compound-engineering review menu. |
| `compound-engineering:ce-architecture-strategist` | Architectural / design-pattern review when adding services or evaluating refactors. | `Agent` tool. |
| `pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter` | Error-handling review (catch blocks, fallback logic, swallowed errors). | `Agent` tool. |
| `compound-engineering:ce-data-migration-expert` | DB migration safety, ID mappings, schema changes. | `Agent` tool. |

These names match the current compound-engineering / pr-review-toolkit suites. The mapping is updated when the suites change — that's a cheatsheet edit (this file), not a methodology rewrite. `docs/methodology.md` §I cites this appendix; do not duplicate the list elsewhere.
